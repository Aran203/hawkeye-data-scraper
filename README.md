# hawkeye-data-scraper 🏏🦅
A repository in which I scrape [Indian Premier League (IPL)](https://www.iplt20.com/) Hawkeye data to extract relevant ball by ball information.

## Motivation 💡
Cricket, like many other sports, is a complex game where strategic decisions can heavily influence outcomes. Hopefully, data is being used in some capacity to drive these decisions. Unfortunately, access to such detailed data isn't always available to the general public, despite its tremendous potential to unearth new insights.

This project came about because I wanted to dig deeper into IPL matches, gathering ball-by-ball data for completed IPL matches. By scraping this data and storing it neatly in CSV files (can be found in the *data* directory), I hope to make this dataset accessible to others who share a passion for cricket analysis.

## Features ✨
- Scrapes bbb data of completed IPL 2024 matches.
- Stores data in an organized CSV files that can be used in analysis.

## Acknowledgement 🙌
Would like to thank [Himanish Ganjoo](https://twitter.com/hganjoo_153) for his support. The ball by ball dataset provided by him [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bab0f36l6j7iunjtjpmpk/t20_bbb.csv?rlkey=n5ves62ma5clehpeqcsn0pfnl&e=1&dl=0) was used in enhancing the quality of this dataset by providing information about certain attributes (extras, dismissals) that Hawkeye surprisingly didn't provide.

## To do 🔨

1. Fix wrong player names? (For example, correct Ganesh to Ruturaj)
2. Add info about which batter is run out?
